:peacorrupt: Huff....huff...this is the most fun I've had in a long time.
:peacorrupt: Especially compared to my days at the lab...
:teaneutral: Lab?
:feversmile: (Psst. A lab is a type of dog. They're cute, four legged creatures that run around and wag their tails.)
:teathink: Oh, I think we have those back home, too.
:peacorrupt: Truth be told, I didn't even care about being mayor of this boring ass town. I'm not much of a leader anyway.
:feverpointtwo: You don't say?
:peacorrupt: I just wanted to fight, and you entertained that urge well enough.
:defrown: How fucking annoying.
:peaew: Eh?-
:defrown: What makes you think I have any FUCKING time for your shenanigans?
:defrown: You peep and invade our privacy, you don’t know how to SHUT the fuck up-
:demonwtf: And worst of all, you’ve got me all pissed off. Go annoy some other bitches, and get the fuck off my property.

:demonwtftwo: Did he stub his toe or some shit?
:suskek: Your insults are so violently sweet, Fever! I can feel the disgust in both of your eyes burning a hole into me.
:suskek: And you're a demon, too, so it hurts even more...~
:teaannoy: What's with people and bringing up race on this planet?
:suskek: I THINK I MIGHT GO CRAZY! PLEASE BE EVEN MORE MEAN! INSULT ME LIKE THE LOWLY TRASH THAT I AM!
:demonwtftwo: WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH EVERYONE IN THIS TOWN?
:teatwo: I want to go back home.
:suskek: Your words wound me so~! this is all so....
:suskek: THRILLING!
:teaannoy: Fever-
