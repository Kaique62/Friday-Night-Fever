:teathink: So, what's the schedule for today?
:feverconfuse: This one's new. Someone in town gave me a letter, and told them to go to this spot at this time.
:teaneutral: So, you're just gonna do it?
:feversmile: Might as well.
:feversmile: Seems like a challenge.
:teaannoy: That rule where you HAVE to accept all challenges is pretty lame.
:feverworry: Yeah, yeah- I know, God. I'll change it soon.
:feversmile: Let's just go.
:narrator:
:feversmile: There's a lot of limos in this parking lot.
:teathink: Maybe someone famous is in town?
:feversmile: Oddly enough, Fever Town IS a hot vacation spot...
:teaneutral: Probably cause rules are so scarce here. Anyone can come into Fever Town, do shady shit, then probably leave without any repercussions.
:fevertired: Thanks for making me feel better about the way I run things.
:narrator: ???: If you're tired of running, how about we give you a ride?
:feverconfuse: Huh?
:bg: hunni
:song: honeyinst
:narrator: So, you're the mayor? I've seen your face around, but you're a lot shorter than I expected. I'm Hunni, but there's no need to tell you my name.
:hunnismile: Cause after I beat you, the rest of the world will know soon.
:impy: Hey I'm Impy. You are pretty short.
:feverpointtwo: Not fair to say that when you're on top of that limo.
:hunnismile: Then why dont you two hurry up and get on already? Unless you're already intimidated by my aura?
:feversilly: Pfft, intimidated? As if! Tea and I are a power couple, there's nothing that could-
:teatwo: EUGH.
:teatwo: WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT?
:feverconfuse: Huh? What are what?
:teatwo: Those... large, fluffy, white things. They look like...
:feverconfuse: You mean the bunnies?
:hunnismile: You mean my babies? Aren't they beautiful? Every single one of them answer to me, and me only.
:hunnismile: I guess you can say I'm their mama in a way.
:feversmile: That's cute. In a weird, giant bunny kinda way. Which reminds me...
:teatwo: Why do ya'll have my ancestors enslaved???
:teaannoy: Yeah, no, I'm out.
:feverscared: Tea? Hey, wait- where are you going???
:teaannoy: I'm gonna be sick. I'll see you back home, Fever.
:narrator:. . .
:hidebgg:
:hunnismile: Power couple, huh?
:feverpointtwo: You know it!
:hunnismile: I wasn't expecting this either... but hey, this just tips the scales in my favor. Not like you had any chance against me anyway.
:feverpointtwo: I don't need someone backing me up to win! Tea's just a bonus!
:feversilly: A very, very hot bonus.
:hunnismile: I can respect that mentality. I'm also used to having the most lovely individual in the world cheering me on~.
:impy:Aww! Hunni-
:hunnismile: My cute bunny! And this one, and this one! Come to mama! You're gonna dance so well for me, aren't you?~
:impy: Bitch.
:feverpointtwo: Whatever! You can have them cheer you on all you want, it won't make a difference either way!
:hunnismile: Let's see how long that confidence lasts.
:narrator: Oi! Get off my car!
:feverpointtwo: Huh? Who was-
:narrator: The driver, obviously. Don't mind her.
:fuckoff:
:narrator: Fucking hell.
